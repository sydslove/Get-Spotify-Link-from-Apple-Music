This a an Apple shortcut you can install and use on iOS and iPadOS (and maybe other Apple devices idk).

Its a shortcut that lets you copy the Spotify URL for any song, album or record you find on Apple Music. this is perfect for sharing music with people that use Spotify and not Apple Music (for some reason) as it easily lets them listen to the music you share with them with a single tap.

OBS: This shortcut relies on the Odesli API. I doubt that its gonna shut down in the near future because it's stable and used widely but if it does then the Shortcut will cease go work. If thats the case, i might update it and fix it in the future.

Oh, and this is my first repo/upload to GitHub so i'm new to this. forgive me for being a noob.
